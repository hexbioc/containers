# 05: Reading a Dockerfile / Containerfile


## `FROM` command

Building images involves starting at a base 'layer', followed by adding more 'layers' on top. Consider the additionally
added layer as a change in the base layer - this could be installing a dependency (thus creating new files), making
a configuration change (thus modifying existing files), adding commands, etc.

The `FROM` command specifies which base layer you want to use.
